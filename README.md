A website for data collection for a psychology research project

#The Project

We wanted to see how one's perception of his or her personality differs from others' perception of the individual's personality.

Each individual will pick adjectives from a list which describe him or her.

The adjectives chosen will be used to calculate scores for the Big Five personality traits.

Then the individual will be presented with names of other individuals randomly the name of someone he or she knows is noticed.

The participant will then pick adjectives that describe the other person. He or she will do this for three different people.
